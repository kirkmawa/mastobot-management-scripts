# mastobot-management-scripts
Pretty much uncommented scripts I used to create 3000 bot accounts on my Mastodon instance

Use these at your own risk and ONLY ON A MASTODON INSTANCE YOU ARE THE ADMIN OF.

Of course, your use case is not going to be mine and these are just examples. But the scripts worked for me against Mastodon v1.1.1.
